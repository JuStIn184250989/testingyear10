    <p>Debate - Do Smartphone have a place in the classroom?</p>
    <br>
    <p> I believe that smartphones have a place in the classroom if it is for educational purposes. If it is used to your leisure and not for educational purposes, I dont think it should be allowed. This is because people will always be on their phone and they wont be working on the tasks that the teacher tells you to do. Its pretty much up to the teachers if they allow you or not. Also people might not have phone while their friends may have a phone, this may cause the student to experience negative emotions or thoughts because they are different from others. </p>
